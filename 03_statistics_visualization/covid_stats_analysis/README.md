# 📊 COVID-19 Data Analysis Mini-Project

This project explores real-world COVID-19 trends using publicly available time series data from the [Johns Hopkins University CSSE COVID-19 dataset](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). It applies core concepts of statistics and data analysis to derive meaningful insights, simulate distributions, and demonstrate real-world use cases.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `covid_data_analysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter/Colab notebook with code, visualizations, and explanations
- `cleaned_covid_data.csv` (optional): Processed and filtered CSV for India, US, Brazil, and Germany
- `README.md`: You’re reading it

## 🎯 Objective

Analyze the spread and severity of COVID-19 in major countries by:
- Understanding data distributions
- Calculating statistical measures (mean, median, std, IQR)
- Visualizing trends
- Identifying correlations between key variables (e.g., new cases vs deaths)
- Simulating and modeling distributions using Poisson and Binomial approaches
