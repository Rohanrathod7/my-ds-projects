# 🧾 Retail Store Insights Generator

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Retail Store Insights Generator** is an advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA) project based on a real-world dataset from an online UK-based retail company. This project combines categorical data processing, custom functions, statistical testing, and visualization to uncover actionable insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.

## 📂 Dataset: UCI Online Retail

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Online Retail](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online%2Bretail)
- **Size**: ~541,909 transactions from Dec 2010 to Dec 2011
- **Columns**:
  - `InvoiceNo`, `StockCode`, `Description`, `Quantity`, `InvoiceDate`
  - `UnitPrice`, `CustomerID`, `Country`

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and validate large retail transaction data
- Engineer useful categorical features (order size, sales category)
- Detect outliers, sales patterns, and customer segments
- Apply hypothesis testing to support business decisions
- Use advanced visualizations to communicate insights

## ⚙️ Key Features

### 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed negative quantities (returns)
- Dropped missing `CustomerID`s and duplicates
- Added `TotalValue` column (Quantity × UnitPrice)

### 🧠 Categorical Feature Engineering
- **Order Size** (Small, Medium, Large, Bulk)
- **Sales Category** (Low, Mid, High, Very High)
- **Customer Frequency** (Occasional, Frequent, VIP)
- **Temporal Features**: Hour of Day, Weekday

### 📊 Data Analysis
- `.value_counts()` for frequency distributions
- `.groupby()` and `.agg()` for summarization
- Cross-tabulations by weekday and customer segment
- Correlation matrix of numeric features
- T-test to compare spending across order sizes

### 📈 Visualizations
- Sales by Hour (Line Plot)
- Sales by Weekday (Bar Plot)
- Sales Category by Weekday (Stacked Bar)
- Boxplots for outliers and order value
- Heatmaps for correlation
- Pairplots for multivariate patterns

## 🔍 Insights & Real-World Use Cases

- **Peak Sales Hours**: Noon and 8 PM are peak hours; staffing and servers should scale accordingly.
- **High CLV Segments**: VIP customers contribute disproportionate revenue—ideal for loyalty programs.
- **Sales Patterns by Weekday**: Mid-value orders dominate weekdays; high-value orders increase on weekends.
- **Order Size Matters**: Bulk orders have statistically higher value—design bundling or upselling promotions.
- **Country-Level Spend**: Germany, Netherlands, and France have high per-customer spend—ideal for regional campaigns.
